<h1>toy_problems</h1>

<p><strong>toy_problems</strong> is a compilation of toy problems around functional programming, recursion, and tricky algorithms.  You'll be able to practice solving these prompts and testing your solutions.</p>

<h2>How to start practicing</h2>
<p>Prompts are contained in the toy_problems/src folder. The promps are divided into the following categories:
  <ul>
    <li>Higher order functions</li>: prompts to be solved using higher order function methods, such as reduce, map, filter
    <li>Recursion</li>: prompts to be solved using recursion
    <li>Miscellaneous</li>: miscellaneous prompts of various algorithms
  </ul>  
</p>
