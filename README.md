<h1>toy_problems</h1>

<p><strong>toy_problems</strong> is a compilation of toy problems around functional programming, recursion, and tricky algorithms.  It is designed to be a playground to practice solving such prompts and testing your solutions.</p>

<h2>How to start practicing</h2>
<p>Prompts are contained in the <code>toy_problems/src</code> folder. The prompts are divided into the following categories:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher order functions</strong>: prompts to be solved using higher order function methods, such as reduce, map, filter</li>
    <li><strong>Recursion</strong>: prompts to be solved using recursion</li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: miscellaneous prompts of various algorithms</li>
  </ul>  
</p>

<h2>Testing your answers</h2>

<p>Launch <code>SpecRunner.html</code> in your browser to check answers.  The test runner used is Jasmine.  Also, <code>index.html</code> is provided as an easier avenue to debug code using Chrome Dev Tools.</p>
