  <p>When completing exercises, you'll want to work with the console on <em>this page</em>. <b>Right click and press 'Inspect' to access the console.</b> Whenever you make changes in the <code>javascript</code> file you are working on, do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Save</strong> the javascript file (e.g. "recursion.js").</li>
    <li><strong>Refresh</strong> this page. Use CMD-R (Mac) or CTRL-R (Windows/Linux) to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use the Chrome console as you would any console, calling your functions inside to see if they work. <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console>Take a look here for more information.</a> Don't forget about debugging with Developer Tools!</p>
